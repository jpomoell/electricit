ELECTRICIT: Electric Field Inversion Toolkit
============================================

ELECTRICIT (pronounced electrikit) is a toolkit for computing the solar 
photospheric electric field given a time sequence of photospheric 
observations, in particular the magnetic field. The toolkit currently 
focuses on supporting the use of data produced by the Helioseismic and 
Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument onboad the Solar Dynamics Observatory 
(SDO) spacecraft, but in principle any data source can be used. 

The software is based on concepts presented in [Lumme et al. (2017)](
https://doi.org/10.1007/s11207-017-1214-0) and [Lumme et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11207-019-1475-x). The open-source version
distributed in this repository is a re-implementation of the 
original software that has been used in a number of scientific studies, including the works above.

Please note that **this version of ELECTRICIT is currently early 
phase software (public alpha). Please stay tuned for updates!**
